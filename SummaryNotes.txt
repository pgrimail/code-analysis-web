All notes below are in response and extension of commit notes from Pull Request.

1) Adding 3rd party CDNs and JQuery for basic, enhanced UI/UX controls. Instead of using out-of-the-box controls, UI/UX 
		should always be taken into account for applications. Although this is a code analysis and only the most basic styling
		was added for effect, further time spent would include: 
		- Enhancement to table formatting & colors
		- Addition of header elements for discernibility between section
		- Addition of directions/description of application
		- Addition of column sorting/filtering in place of buttons
		
2) .slice() should never be used with an array unless otherwise intending to remove an item from an array. Additionally, further 
		"dangers" of .slice() is knowing at which index the intended item to be removed is. When copying an array, we only need
		to set a new variable to the original variable/parameter in which the array is located/stored. This will not mutate the
		original array when changing the new variable.
		
3) Name search prior to the commit would not work unless a person's name's type & value were the same as that of the searched value.
		Changing the validation from type & value (===) to .includes() allows us to search on the inputted value in real-time where any
		name, first or last, may include the string of characters being searched.
		
4) Prior sort functionality for first name had worked without issues, however when sorting by last name, it was simply reversing the 
		order of the returned array. Adding a new parameter of "subDetail" allowed the function to now have the scope of the sort
		type, first or last. Once this was determined, it was possible to use the getFirstName/getLastName functions to return the
		first/last name to sort by, depending on the scope, of course.
